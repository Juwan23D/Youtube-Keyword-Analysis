# Summary of Insights

In order to find which keywords brought in the most traffic, we combined the metrics above in GoogleBigQuery with SQL.
Thus creating new metrics such as Most viewed keyword, Most Liked Keyword, and Top Liked Comments by Keyword.

### Most Viewed Keyword:

* The most viewed keywords showed what was involved in searching for their desired video. This revealed that google was seen the most with over 46 billion views, showcasing its importance in searches. Google was also the 
keyword with the most liked video "El Chombo - Dame Tu Cosita feat. Cutty Ranks (Official Video) [Ultra Music]" which had 164,455,580 likes.

* Second was animals with 19.74% (36 billion views).

* Third was Mr. Beast 18.31% (33 billion views).

### Most Liked Keywords:

* Mr.beast was involved in multiple videos and held the biggest share of likes with 42.14% (1,000,000,000+). 

* Second was animals with 11.57% (289,094,467). 

* Google was third with 8.49% (212,024,296) which I noticed was a significant variation compared to how much views it generated. 

### Top Liked Comments by Keyword:

* The most liked comments came from the Mr beast category and the number 1 was ‘Like I said in the video, subscribe if you haven’t already and you could win $10,000!’ coming from Mr beast on the video ‘$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!’.
* Mr.Beast captured 8/10 of the top liked comments, indicating his influence has on his viewers.

# Recommendations & Next Steps

* Mr.Beast has a very strong notable online presence, and fostering a positive relationship with him would generate signicant growth to platforms and business looking to expand.

* Use Google to help understand the viewer. Google didn't generate as many likes as it did views, but it did show its a major player in bringing people to videos. Using their tools such as google analytics and google trends, 
can help gauge a better understanding of what viewers are searching for, thus helping content creators or digital marketers understand the kind of content to produce.

* Lofi had the highest average positive sentiment rate which was 1.83 and Mr.Beast was 10th with 1.65. This opens up doors of opportunity for content collaborations such as a lofi/ animal 
or mr. beast/music piece of content. Generating a high positive sentiment shows what people are willing to spend their time on, and this feedback could open the door to new ideas.
